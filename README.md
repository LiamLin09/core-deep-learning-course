Deep learning is one of the most emerging domains in this era, Learning Deep Learning is worth it! We present ML002 a full deep learning course from scratch covering mathematics basics to some level in deep learning. We saw many students suffering for not getting the right resources to learn for free. 

We already presented a full-fledged machine learning course ML001 by Antern for absolutely free, covering in-depth machine learning for beginners. Now Antern Presents ML002, a full course on Deep Learning. 

We also identified some problems that free courses have and feedback from our previous courses and tried to improve our content based on that. So, Let’s get started! 

## Why to Learn Deep Learning? 

Whether you’re an aspirant of becoming a data scientist or machine learning engineer, nowadays having a good knowledge of deep learning is a must. It sets you very well and gives you a new way of thinking about “how machines learn?”.  

It also sets you a foundation of learning from images and texts, and In this era for data scientists and machine learning engineers or AI Engineers, Deep Learning should be in their skillset.
